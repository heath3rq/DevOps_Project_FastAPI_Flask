# Project Description

The project is for IDS 706 Data Engineering class at Duke University. The goal is to create a Microservice that returns a JSON payload and performs a Data Engineering related task. We are expected to perform Continuous Integration with Github Actions and configure build server to deploy changes on build for Continuous Delivery, while using Flask/FastAPI.
