## Project Description

The project is done for IDS 706 Data Engineering class at Duke University. The goal is to create a Microservice that returns a JSON payload and performs a Data Engineering related task. We are expected to perform Continuous Integration with Github Actions and configure build server to deploy changes on build for Continuous Delivery. Therefore, I built a menu generator app for one of my favorite restuarant. Both Flask and FastAPI were leveraged to display the randomly generated menus. I then enabled Continuous Integration with Github Actions and Continuous Delivery with AWS CodeBuild.

## Instructions To Replicate the Process Yourself
To run the python scripts after cloning the repository, type in your terminal: python <filename>.py. An example is `python menu_fastapi_app.py`. There will be a window pop-up on the bottom right corner of your Codespace instance to assess the temprorary web app. A sample output looks like:
```
